 *
local vs global
window |  energy function across the whole image

global: markov random field modelling -> iterative

 *
pixel based:
    - absolute difference (AD and TAD)
    - squared difference

area based:
    - sum od absolute distance
    - sum squared dist
    - normalied cross correlation
    - rank transform
    - census transform

    (assume all pixels within a window have similar disparities) * can abuse?

    - Recently, Miron et al. [26] tested various matching cost functions in their stereo disparity map algorithms for intelligent vehicle applications we test for all scenes?

feature based:
    -Sharma et al sift variant


cost aggregation:

refinement:
    - regularization
    - occlusion filling
    - interpolation (?)

    - gaussian convolution


semiglobal???

global
    - belief propagation
    - graph cut

^^ base code? we can tweak
